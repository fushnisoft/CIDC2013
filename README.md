Fushnisoft @ CIDC2013
=====================

[Clarion International Developers Conference 2013](http://cidc2013.com/)

What a great conference it was! In this repo you will find all the notes and resources used during my two talks at CIDC2013. Hopefully someone will find it helpful...

## Downloads

I am not sure if this is the right place for this. 
The directory contains a complete compiled version of the In-App Analytics enabled Invoice.app.

## Notes

My speaking notes for each session. There is detail in there that I didn't get to cover and probably some missing but mostly only bad jokes. It may be interesting, I may use parts of it on http://clarionedge.com
