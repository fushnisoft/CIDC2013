CIDC2013
========

These are all the resources for my CIDC2013 presentations.

## Downloads

I am not sure if this is the right place for this. 
The directory contains a complete compiled version of the In-App Analytics enabled Invoice.app.

## Notes

My speaking notes and cheat sheets for the sessions. Well... soon I hope!

## Presentations

Reveal.js based presentations. Hopefully these work ok on a projector :D

## Source

All the source code, Clarion and C# for the App Analytics presentation.

For the Devstart.io presenation, go to http://Destart.io and grab yourself a copy!
