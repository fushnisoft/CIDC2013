In this repo you will find all the notes and resources used during my two talks at CIDC2013. Hopefully someone will find it helpful...\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the right place for this. \r\nThe directory contains a complete compiled version of the In-App Analytics enabled Invoice.app.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fushnisoft/CIDC2013/tree/master/Downloads\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nMy speaking notes for each session. There is detail in there that I didn't get to cover and probably some missing but mostly only bad jokes. It may be interesting, I may use parts of it on http://clarionedge.com \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fushnisoft/CIDC2013/tree/master/Notes\r\n\r\n## Presentations\r\n\r\nReveal.js based presentations. I think these were pretty successful, thanks everyone for playing along!\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fushnisoft/CIDC2013/tree/master/Presentations\r\n\r\n## Source\r\n\r\nAll the source code, Clarion and C# for the App Analytics presentation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fushnisoft/CIDC2013/tree/master/Source\r\n\r\n## Devstart.io\r\n\r\nAnd of course go and sign up for your copy of the Devstart.io super StartPage addin!!\r\n\r\nhttp://Destart.io\r\n\r\n-brahn\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
